Coffee Production Data for all Countries, 2013-2016- http://www.ico.org/prices/po-production.pdf 
Latitude and Longitude:negative value is S and W

Brazil
Rust Data: June 2008-Dec 2009 - Paolo - Table 1
Rust Data: Sep 05-Aug 2006 - Jaipiassu - Figure 4

Papa New Guinea
Rust Data: Brown
Rust % - used average of Onaningka, Kayokite and Bena plots in figure 1 by month since they both had same climate type (wet seasonally dry) - reasonable approximation
Weather Data (Rainfall and Temperature averages by month)- http://sdwebx.worldbank.org/climateportal/index.cfm?page=country_historical_climate&ThisCCode=PNG

Colombia
Rust Data: Jan-December 1995 - Ruiz Cardenas 
figure 1 - % rust incidence = 100-% alive = 100 - (striped bars in figure 1)- will take an average of %Supia, %La Catalina and %Naranjal at 60 days after flowering - samples are from trees

	= 1- ((48+38+20)/3) = 1-35.33 = 34.33% - will use this one value for all months
	
Aug 2011- March 2013-  Corrales
Average of 16 samples to calculate monthly rust rate %
Production 1995: http://www.coffeeresearch.org/market/production.htm

As with most real-world data science projects, we were limited in our analysis by data that is available. Surprisingly there is minimal freely available rust data from some of the other top coffee producing nations such as Vietnam or Indonesia. Perhaps if we had the assistance of a coffee domain expert, we would have been able to include this data in our analysis. However, since Brazil and Colombia are in the top 5 coffee producers, we feel our data is a representative sample.
