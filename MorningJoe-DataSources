Colombia
Rust Data: January - December 1995 - Ruiz Cardenas 
Figure 1 - % rust incidence = percent dead leaves = 100 -% alive leaves = 100 - (striped bars in figure 1)- will take an average of %Supia, %La Catalina and %Naranjal at 60 days after flowering - samples are from trees not individual leaves

		= 1- ((48+38+20)/3) = 1-35.33 = 34.33% - will use this one value for all months
